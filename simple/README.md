# Living the simple life
Welcome to my first project in responsive design that called Living the simple life, are you ready to start üòÅ!

## Description
A project created using responsive design with media queries and a flexbox that adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The responsive design is achieved by using media queries, which allow the layout and content to adjust dynamically based on the screen size and orientation.

Flexbox is a powerful CSS layout module that provides a flexible and efficient way to align and distribute elements within a container. It allows for the creation of complex, responsive layouts with ease, and can be used in combination with media queries to achieve a highly adaptable and responsive design.

Overall, a project created using responsive design with media queries and flexbox is a highly adaptable and user-friendly web application or website that provides a seamless user experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
  * Flex Box
  * Mrdia Quary

## Run Code
We can show the pages of the project from github-pages 

https://momen-odeh.github.io/Responsitive-Design-Living-the-simple-life/

## Real Example
let's take the head of the page as an example on different devices such as Desktops with a screen size of 1440px and mobile with a screen size of 425px.

#### Desktop Screen 1440px

#### Mobile Screen 425px

* as we see the content reorders it self according the size of the screen

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
